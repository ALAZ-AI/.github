# ALAZ
## Intelligent DNS Firewall System

ALAZ is a high-performance DNS firewall that protects networks by intelligently filtering malicious domains and categorizing web traffic. It combines real-time DNS resolution with machine learning-powered threat detection to provide both security and content filtering capabilities.

## Core Design Principles

- **Performance First**: Sub-millisecond DNS response times through intelligent caching
- **Intelligence-Driven**: Machine learning models for automated threat detection and content classification
- **User Control**: Granular policy management with category-based filtering
- **Scalable Architecture**: Microservices design for high availability and horizontal scaling

## System Architecture

ALAZ consists of four specialized components working together:

### 1. SENTRY - DNS Engine
The high-performance DNS resolver that handles all incoming queries. It operates with a multi-tier lookup strategy:
- **Fast Path**: Instant responses from Redis cache for known domains
- **Database Path**: Policy lookup for cached verdicts 
- **Forward Path**: Real-time resolution for unknown domains while queuing for analysis

Key features:
- Sub-millisecond response times for cached queries
- Automatic failover and load balancing
- Real-time policy enforcement
- Comprehensive query logging

### 2. CODEX - Data Layer
The central data repository storing policies, domain intelligence, and activity logs. Manages:
- **User Policies**: Category-based filtering rules and custom domain lists
- **Domain Intelligence**: Threat classifications and content categories
- **Activity Logs**: Complete DNS query history and analytics data
- **System Configuration**: Global settings and user preferences

### 3. ORACLE - Intelligence Pipeline
The machine learning engine that analyzes unknown domains asynchronously:
- **Threat Detection**: Identifies malicious domains using lexical analysis and reputation data
- **Content Classification**: Categorizes domains by content type (social media, news, gaming, etc.)
- **Continuous Learning**: Adapts to new threats and improves accuracy over time
- **Batch Processing**: Handles analysis queues efficiently without impacting DNS performance

### 4. PANEL - Management Interface
The web-based dashboard providing user control and analytics:
- **Policy Management**: Configure category filters and custom allow/block lists
- **Real-time Analytics**: Monitor DNS traffic, blocked threats, and usage patterns
- **User Administration**: Account management and API access control
- **Reporting**: Generate detailed security and usage reports

## Key Features

### Security Protection
- **Malware Blocking**: Automatic detection and blocking of malicious domains
- **Phishing Prevention**: AI-powered identification of suspicious domains
- **Real-time Updates**: Continuous threat intelligence updates

### Content Filtering
- **Category-based Filtering**: Block entire content categories (ads, social media, gaming)
- **Custom Rules**: User-defined allow/block lists with priority handling
- **Time-based Policies**: Schedule filtering rules for different times of day

### Performance & Reliability
- **High Availability**: Redundant architecture with automatic failover
- **Global Caching**: Distributed cache layers for optimal response times
- **Analytics & Monitoring**: Comprehensive visibility into DNS traffic and threats

### User Experience
- **Zero Configuration**: Works immediately with smart defaults
- **Granular Control**: Fine-tune policies to specific needs
- **Detailed Insights**: Understand network traffic patterns and security posture

## Data Flow

1. **DNS Query Received**: Client requests domain resolution
2. **Cache Lookup**: Check Redis for instant policy decision
3. **Policy Evaluation**: Apply user-defined rules and global policies
4. **Resolution**: Return appropriate response (block, allow, or redirect)
5. **Intelligence Queue**: Unknown domains sent for ML analysis
6. **Learning Loop**: Analysis results fed back to improve future decisions

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Security**: Proactive protection against DNS-based threats
- **Improved Productivity**: Content filtering reduces distractions and bandwidth usage
- **Complete Visibility**: Detailed analytics on network DNS activity
- **Easy Management**: Intuitive interface for policy configuration
- **High Performance**: No noticeable impact on browsing speed
